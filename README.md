# React-Redux - To-Do list
## How you view
You should view step by step if you want to know about React-Redux:
 * Step 0 (`index.js`): Data structures
 * Step 1 (`reducer.js`): Creating reducer
 * Step 2 (`index.js`): Creating store after you have created reducer
 * Step 3 (`actions.js`): Creating actions (Redux dispatchs)
 * Step 4 (`todos.components.js`)
    * Step 4a: Mapping Redux dispatchs to React props by using mapDispatchToProps()
    * Step 4b: Mapping Redux state to React props by using mapStateToProps()
    * Step 4c: Creating React class component. View more on `lists.component.js`
* Step 5 (`todos.components.js`): Creating connection between Redux state and actions (dispatchs) with React class component by using connect()
* Step 6 (`index.js`): Rendering by Provider
